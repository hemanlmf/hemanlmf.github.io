### Online Reference
1. [Course website](https://sites.google.com/site/kwchankeith/teaching/s4010/s4010-2021Spring)  
This should be your major reference for revision  
2. [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)  
Rmd is very useful if you want to incorporate R, LaTeX or other languages like Python in the same documentation. You can use it for your HW  
3. [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)  
Wolfram Alpha provides symbolic computation (and many other functions) which is useful for HW (e.g. simplifying algebraic expression)
