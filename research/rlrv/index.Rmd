## Supplementary Materials
1. [Reading Group - Asymptotic theory for stationary processes](Reading Group - Asymptotic theory for stationary processes.pdf)  
Wu (2005) developed a beautiful and coherent asymptotic framework for inference of stationary process. Apart from using them in this research, I am also delighted to share them with other members of [research group](https://sites.google.com/site/kwchankeith/e-learning/reading-group)
